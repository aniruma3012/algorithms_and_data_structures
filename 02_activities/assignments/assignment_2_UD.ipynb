    "#I was able to improve my knowledge of stacks and Python algorithmic problem-solving by working on Question Two, Valid Bracket Sequence. I tackled the issue by realizing that a stack's last-in, first-out structure makes it perfect for tracking the most recent unmatched opening brackets. I started my solution with an empty stack and a dictionary that matched each closing bracket to its matching opening bracket. I pushed opening brackets onto the stack as I went along the string. When I came across a closing bracket, I carefully removed the top element from the stack—using a placeholder if the stack was empty—and compared it to the mapping's predicted opening bracket. The function returned False right away if the brackets did not match. At the end, I returned True if the stack was empty, indicating all brackets were correctly matched.\n",
